working title  


this is a fps project developed using three.js and cannon.js.  


this is (to be) a level based pve fps built for the web.
apart from the rendering engine and physics engine, everything seen  
has been made using javascript, html, and css... and ms paint.
mutliple unique weapons, enemies, buffs, drops, and worlds

still lots of work to do, hopefully soon the first level/alpha  
will be playable here: https://stevesgame.com
